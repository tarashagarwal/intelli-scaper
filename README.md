What is Scrapy-Splash?

Scrapy = A very fast web scraper framework.

Splash = A lightweight headless browser (built on top of WebKit) that can render JavaScript and then give the result to Scrapy.

Scrapy-Splash = A connector that lets Scrapy talk to Splash.

ðŸ‘‰ Together, they let you scrape JavaScript-heavy websites (the ones that donâ€™t show full content in plain HTML).

Why use Scrapy-Splash instead of Selenium?

Faster than Selenium because Splash is made for scraping.

Integrates easily with Scrapy pipelines, middlewares, and scheduling.

Headless by default (no heavy Chrome GUI).

Can also execute Lua scripts inside Splash to control page (wait, scroll, click).
